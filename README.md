## Description
This Python script sorts your ModConfigs.xml (RimWorld mod configuration) for better loading time 
putting the dependencies of your mod order in the right spot. This is also the only function of the 
script, it will do this one thing and nothing else. 

Managing mods ((un)subscribing, mod load lists etc) is beyond the scope of this script, there 
is a better ingame solution called "Mod Manager" by Fluffy. The only thing it does, is optimizing
the mod load order.

For using the script you need an active internet connection which will connect to Github, where
the current sort order database resides.
