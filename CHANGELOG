RWMS (RimWorldModSorter) changelog:

0.94.1 (2019-05-04):
new:
- asks if script may open a new browser window to RWMSDB issues tracker if unknown mods are detected.
- table of contents in documentation.
- added documentation about contents of the unknown data file which is generated for submission.

modified:
- reworked data format for unknown mods file, now has versioning, some meta information about installation
  and Steam Workshop links to mods if steam support is not disabled. Reason for including this meta information
  is relieving me from the guesswork of the installation I'm already doing if I have to pinpoint bugs.
- reworked script output wording and flow a bit.
- automatically sanitize contributor name, if an email address is provided. I already did this manually in the
  unknown mod submissions.

Concerning the inclusion of the operating system metadata in the unknown mods file:
This will only include the output of the Python "sys.platform" call, which will produce "darwin", "win32" or "linux".
Please refer to the documentation page https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.platform for more details.
If I need more platform-specific details, I will ask directly in the issue / forum.

0.94.0 (2019-04-25):
new:
- automatic issue creation, if you put in your Github credentials in the configuration file.

changed:
- reworked output on the command line, now leaner, less scroll and (hopefully) more informative.
- updated documentation, especially the configuration file
- reworked changelog (you are reading this)
- (2019-04-26) documentation changes regarding module requirements, nothing new to the code itself.

fixed:
- several fatal errors did not honor the waitforkeypress_on_error in the configuration file.

Note that I am aware that there is also a token / OAuth system available for the GitHub API, but I could
not get it to work with just having access to issues. If you have a workable solution (in Python 3), please
contact me.
