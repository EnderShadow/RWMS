RWMS (RimWorldModSorter) changelog:


0.94.0 (2019-04-25):
new:
- automatic issue creation, if you put in your Github credentials in the configuration file.

changed:
- reworked output on the command line, now leaner, less scroll and (hopefully) more informative.
- updated documentation, especially the configuration file
- reworked changelog (you are reading this)
- (2019-04-26) documentation changes regarding module requirements, nothing new to the code itself.

fixed:
- several fatal errors did not honor the waitforkeypress_on_error in the configuration file.

Note that I am aware that there is also a token / OAuth system available for the GitHub API, but I could
not get it to work with just having access to issues. If you have a workable solution (in Python 3), please
contact me.
